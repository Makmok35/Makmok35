- 👋 Hi, I’m @Makmok35
- 👀 I have one big problem: It's difficult to find something that doesn't interest me!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to be focused on Data Science and AI, having learnt how to manage with Git and GitHub. I have also learnt the fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and currently I'm being taught C, C++, Ada and Java at the univerisity. It will be a big challenge, but not impossible.
- 💞️ I’m looking for people with interests in learning and sharing them with the community
- 📫 How to reach me, through GitHub!
